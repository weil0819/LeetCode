# Top Interview Questions

## Introduction
This is LeetCode's official curated list of Top classic interview questions to help you land your dream job. Our top interview questions are divided into the following series:

- Easy Collection
- Medium Collection
- Hard Collection  
to help you master Data Structure & Algorithms and improve your coding skills.

Just like any other skills, coding interview is one area where you can greatly improve with deliberate practice.

Most of the classic interview questions have multiple solution approaches. For the best practice result, we strongly advise you to go through this list at least a second time, or even better - a third time.

By the second attempt, you may discover some new tricks or new methods. By the third time, you should find that your code appear to be more concise compared to your first attempt. If so, congratulations!

Remember: Deliberate practice does not mean looking for answers and memorizing it. You won't go very far with that approach. The more you are able to solve a problem yourself without any reference to answers, the more you will improve. 


### Array
Array type of questions were asked in interviews frequently. You will most likely encounter one during your interviews.

We recommend: Single Number, Rotate Array, Intersection of Two Arrays II and Two Sum.  
- [x] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- [x] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
- [x] Rotate Array
- [x] Contains Duplicate
- [x] Single Number
- [x] Intersection of Two Arrays II
- [x] Plus One
- [x] Move Zeroes
- [x] Two Sum
- [x] Valid Sudoku
- [x] Rotate Image  


### Strings
String type of questions were asked in interviews frequently. You will most likely encounter one during your interviews.

We recommend: Reverse String, First Unique Character in a String, String to Integer (atoi) and Implement strStr().  
- [x] Reverse String
- [x] Reverse Integer
- [x] First Unique Character in a String
- [x] Valid Anagram
- [x] Valid Palindrome
- [x] String to Integer (atoi)
- [x] Implement strStr()
- [x] Count and Say
- [x] Longest Common Prefix


### Linked List
Linked List problems are relatively easy to master. Do not forget the Two-pointer technique, which not only applicable to Array problems but also Linked List problems as well.

Another technique to greatly simplify coding in linked list problems is the dummy node trick.

We recommend: Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists and Linked List Cycle.

For additional challenge, solve these problems recursively: Reverse Linked List, Palindrome Linked List and Merge Two Sorted Lists.  
- [x] Delete Node in a Linked List
- [x] Remove Nth Node From End of List
- [x] Reverse Linked List
- [x] Merge Two Sorted Lists
- [x] Palindrome Linked List
- [x] Linked List Cycle


### Trees
Tree is slightly more complex than linked list, because the latter is a linear data structure while the former is not. Tree problems can be solved either breadth-first or depth-first. We have one problem here which is great for practicing breadth-first traversal.

We recommend: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree, Validate Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree Level Order Traversal and Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree.  
- [x] Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- [x] Validate Binary Search Tree
- [x] Symmetric Tree
- [x] Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
- [x] Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree  


### Sorting and Searching
These problems deal with sorting or searching in a sorted structure.

We recommend First Bad Version as a great introduction to a very important algorithm.  
- [x] Merge Sorted Array
- [x] First Bad Version  


### Dynamic Programming
Here are some classic Dynamic Programming interview questions.

We recommend: Climbing Stairs, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock and Maximum Subarray.  
- [x] Climbing Stairs
- [x] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- [x] Maximum Subarray
- [x] House Robber  


### Design
These problems may require you to implement a given interface of a class, and may involve using one or more data structures. These are great exercises to improve your data structure skills.

We recommend: Shuffle an Array and Min Stack.  
- [x] Shuffle an Array
- [x] Min Stack  


### Math
Most of the math questions asked in interviews do not require math knowledge beyond middle school level.

We recommend: Count Primes and Power of Three.  
- [x] Fizz Buzz
- [x] Count Primes
- [x] Power of Three
- [x] Roman to Integer  


### Others
Here are some other questions that do not fit in other categories.

We recommend: Number of 1 Bits and Valid Parentheses. 
- [x] Number of 1 Bits
- [x] Hamming Distance
- [x] Reverse Bits
- [x] Pascal's Triangle
- [x] Valid Parentheses
- [x] Missing Number
