272. Closest Binary Search Tree Value II -- Hard
http://www.leetfree.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value-ii.html

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Note:
Given target value is a floating point.
You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Follow up:
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?
